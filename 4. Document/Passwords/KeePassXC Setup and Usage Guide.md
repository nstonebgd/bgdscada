# KeePassXC Setup and Usage Guide

This guide outlines the steps for downloading, installing, and using KeePassXC to access our shared password database.

## Introduction

In an effort to better secure our devices, we have implemented an active password database. This database is currently protected by a single master password. As everyone becomes familiar with the setup, we may introduce additional security measures.

## Downloading and Installing KeePassXC

### Visit the KeePassXC Website

- Open your web browser.
- Go to the [KeePassXC official website](https://keepassxc.org/).

### Download the Installer

- Click on the 'Download' button.
- Select the version appropriate for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

### Install KeePassXC

- Once downloaded, run the installer.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

## Opening the Shared Database

### Open KeePassXC

- Launch KeePassXC from your applications menu or desktop shortcut.

### Locate the Shared Database File

- Navigate to `P:\Documents\BGD SCADA Standards\09 Database\`.
- Find the file named `bgdscada.kdbx`.

### Open the Database

- In KeePassXC, go to `File > Open Database`.
- Browse to the `bgdscada.kdbx` file and select it.
- Ask me for the master password. This is the shared password known to everyone who needs access.

## Important Note

### Shared Database

- **Be aware that this is a shared database.**
- Any changes you make, such as deleting entries, will affect all users who access this database.
- **Do not delete or modify any entries** unless you are sure it should be changed for everyone.

Please note that you should replace the placeholders with actual links or accurate paths as needed. Also, ensure to communicate the master password securely to authorized users.
