**SCADA and Design Engineering Collaboration**

**Overview:**
In our ongoing efforts to meet and exceed client expectations on projects involving Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, it is imperative that our SCADA engineers closely collaborate with our design engineering teams. This internal strategy document outlines the necessary steps and considerations for ensuring all client-specified deliverables are fully integrated and operational within the agreed timelines and quality standards.

**Key Objectives:**

1. **Ensure Deliverable Integration:** Early and ongoing communication between SCADA engineers and design teams is crucial. This ensures that all client-promised features and functionalities are included in the initial design phase, avoiding costly and time-consuming revisions later.
2. **Hardware and Software Compatibility:** Selecting the right combination of hardware and software is fundamental for the success of a SCADA project. Compatibility issues can lead to significant delays and increased costs. SCADA engineers should work hand-in-hand with design engineers to review and approve all proposed solutions before implementation.
3. **Coordination Meetings:** Schedule meetings between SCADA and design teams to discuss project progress, challenges, and solutions. These meetings should focus on reviewing project milestones, timelines, and ensuring that the project remains aligned with client expectations.
4. **Feedback Loop:** Implement a structured feedback loop involving the client, contractors, SCADA engineers, and design engineers. This will help in capturing any changes in client requirements or expectations early in the project lifecycle and adjusting the project plan accordingly.
5. **Technical Review Sessions:** Conduct technical review sessions at key project milestones. These sessions should involve critical assessments of the system's architecture, functionality, and performance against the project's requirements and objectives.

**Action Items:**

- Develop a checklist of client requirements and expectations to be reviewed and signed off by both SCADA and design teams.
- Establish a project communication plan outlining the frequency and format of coordination meetings and technical review sessions.
- Create a compatibility matrix for hardware and software selection to be used as a guide during the planning phase.
- Notify SCADA department of project timeline
- Maintain active communication with contractors to ensure SCADA department has adequate programming lead time.
