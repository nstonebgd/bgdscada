# WireGuard Setup Guide for Windows

This guide will walk you through the process of installing WireGuard on Windows and setting up a specific tunnel configuration.

## Installing WireGuard on Windows

### Step 1: Download WireGuard

- Visit the WireGuard Download Page.
  - https://www.wireguard.com/install/
- Choose and download the WireGuard installer for Windows.

### Step 2: Install WireGuard

- Run the downloaded installer.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## Setting Up the WireGuard Tunnel

### Step 1: Launch WireGuard

- Open WireGuard from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.

### Step 2: Add a New Configuration

- In the WireGuard window, click on `Add Tunnel`.
- Choose `Add empty tunnelâ€¦`. This will create a new configuration and generate a public/private key pair.

### Step 3: Configure the Interface

Replace the contents of the new configuration with the following, ensuring to replace `PrivateKey` with your actual private key:

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = private key generated by Wireguard
ListenPort = 57945
Address = 10.client.project.device/32 
DNS = 10.0.0.1, 1.1.1.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = jHCALA+X/aOAkXsc4MD3zPwGHVRai8IMnTY1LaqtFHc=
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/8
Endpoint = 45.32.196.108:51820
```

Example IP Address for project 123-0001: `10.123.1.200`

### Step4: Save the Configuration

- After entering the configuration, save the file.
- WireGuard will add this new tunnel to its main window.

### Step 5: Activate the Tunnel

- Click the `Activate` button next to the new tunnel in the WireGuard window.
- This will establish the VPN connection based on your provided configuration.

## Authorizing IP on the bgdscada Server

For the VPN connection to be fully functional, your connection address needs to be authorized on the bgdscada server.

### Requesting Authorization

- Provide the following to your network administrator:
  - WireGuard Public Key
  - WireGuard IP Address (10.client.project.device/32)
  - Public Static IPv4 Address (if applicable)
- The administrator will add these details to the bgdscada server to authorize your connection.

### Important Note

- Ensure that the provided public key matches the one in your WireGuard configuration.
- Do not share your private key.

## Verifying the Connection

- To verify that the tunnel is working, you can check your IP address or attempt to access resources on the `10.0.0.0/8` network.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that your firewall and router settings allow traffic on the specified `ListenPort`.
- The `PrivateKey` should be kept confidential. Do not share it with unauthorized individuals.
- If you encounter any issues, verify your configuration for any typos or incorrect values.
